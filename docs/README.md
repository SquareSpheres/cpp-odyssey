# C++ Learning Roadmap

This is the complete roadmap document that outlines all six projects, their goals, and the concepts practiced.

## Project Overview

### Project 1: TCP/UDP Ping-Pong Server
Build a simple networking server that echoes messages back to clients.

### Project 2: Multi-threaded Chat Server
Create a chat server handling multiple concurrent clients with thread safety.

### Project 3: File I/O and RAII
Implement file processing utilities using RAII principles and smart pointers.

### Project 4: Template-based Utility Library
Design generic algorithms and type-safe utilities using C++ templates.

### Project 5: Event-driven CLI Application
Build an event loop system with callbacks and task scheduling.

### Project 6: Complete CLI WebRTC Application
Integrate all learned concepts into a peer-to-peer communication application.
