# Project 3: File I/O and RAII

**Status:** Not Started  
**Duration:** [Estimated]

## Goal
Implement file processing utilities demonstrating RAII principles, smart pointers, and move semantics.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] RAII file wrapper class
- [ ] Chunked file processing
- [ ] File transformation utilities
- [ ] Exception-safe operations
- [ ] Move semantics properly implemented

## Concepts Practiced
- Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)
- Move semantics and rvalue references
- RAII patterns
- Exception safety guarantees
- File streams and I/O

## Features Implemented
*Will be filled in during development*

## Build Instructions

cmake --build . --target Project3FileIO
./project3-file-io/Project3FileIO
```

## Usage
*Documentation will be added as features are implemented*

## Testing

```bash
cd build
ctest -R Project3
```

## Design Notes
*Architectural decisions and design rationale*

## Known Issues
*Track issues discovered during development*
