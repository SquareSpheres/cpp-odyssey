# Project 4: Template-based Utility Library

**Status:** Not Started  
**Duration:** [Estimated]

## Goal
Design and implement generic algorithms and type-safe utilities using C++ templates.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Generic algorithm implementations
- [ ] Serialization utilities
- [ ] Type-safe wrappers
- [ ] Comprehensive template documentation
- [ ] Compile-time optimizations

## Concepts Practiced
- Function templates
- Class templates
- Template specialization
- SFINAE and type traits
- Variadic templates
- constexpr and compile-time computation

## Features Implemented
*Will be filled in during development*

## Build Instructions

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target Project4TemplateLibrary
```

## Usage
*Documentation will be added as features are implemented*

## Testing

```bash
cd build
ctest -R Project4
```

## Benchmarks

```bash
cd build
./project4-template-library/benchmarks/benchmark_utils
```

## Design Notes
*Architectural decisions and design rationale*

## Known Issues
*Track issues discovered during development*
