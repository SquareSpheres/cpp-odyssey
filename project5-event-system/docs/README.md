# Project 5: Event-driven CLI Application

**Status:** Not Started  
**Duration:** [Estimated]

## Goal
Build an event loop system with callbacks and task scheduling using lambdas and functional programming patterns.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Task scheduler working
- [ ] Lambda callbacks integrated
- [ ] Async task handling
- [ ] Clean shutdown mechanism

## Concepts Practiced
- Lambda expressions
- std::function and std::bind
- Callbacks and observers
- Event-driven architecture
- Functional programming patterns

## Features Implemented
